### Planned goals
- Run first live coding broadcast
- Use GVim for roadmapping
- Show previously implemented versions of the game
- Assess usage of Node, Deno and terminal graphics libraries on Windows
- Determine whether ChatGPT works well as a development-aiding tool

### Findings
- Broadcast quality was great
- https://awvalenti.github.io/fugaescorregadia/ is not working on Firefox
- blessed and terminal-kit libs apparently work well on CMD, WT/GitBash and PowerShell
- Need to know how to increase font size for GVim to be more useful
- ChatGPT rarely produces actually useful output
- <Leader><Leader>+ increases font size in GVim

### Results
- Broadcast run successfully
- Node, Deno and libs still need analysis
- ChatGPT should be used only when other attempts don't work well
- Demo game using terminal-kit generated successfully by ChatGPT
- Project was uploaded to GitHub

### Planned goals
- Use GVim for roadmapping
- Show previously implemented versions of the game
- Decide on Node or Deno based on distribution of app package
- Decide on which terminal graphics library based on Windows usage
