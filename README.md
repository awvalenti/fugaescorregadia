***Slippery Escape*** is a labyrinth game that runs on the browser.

You can play it anywhere: computer, mobile phone, tablet and so on.

It is work in progress and feedback is welcome! You can
[open an issue](https://github.com/awvalenti/fugaescorregadia/issues/new)
and tell me what you think.

## Technical stuff
Slippery Escape runs on web technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Internally, it is written in [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org), a
nice language that compiles to JavaScript.

## Development

Tools include:
- `ParcelJS`: creates development server and generates distribution package.
  Fast alternative to [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).
- `Babel`: translates new JavaScript code to older versions
- `Mocha`: automated testing
- `NodeJS`: JavaScript runtime, runs many development tools
- `VSCode`: awesome editor

To run Slippery Escape on development mode, you basically need to:
- Have NodeJS installed
- Clone this repository
- Run `npm install` and any of these commands:

```
npm test          # Automated tests on Node.js
npm run tdd       # Automated tests on browser
npm run autoplay  # Simple system test on browser
npm start         # Play game
npm run editor    # Run level editor
```
